;--------------------------- Customizable Settings ----------------------------;

; Online Subsystem Utils Configuration
; Adjusting tick rates for LAN and Internet servers to enhance the frequency of game state updates,
; leading to smoother gameplay and less desynchronization between server and clients.
[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver]
LanServerMaxTickRate=${LanServerMaxTickRate} ; Sets maximum ticks per second for LAN servers, higher rates result in smoother gameplay.
NetServerMaxTickRate=${NetServerMaxTickRate} ; Sets maximum ticks per second for Internet servers, similarly ensuring smoother online gameplay.

; Player Configuration
; These settings are crucial for optimizing the network bandwidth allocation per player,
; allowing for more data to be sent and received without bottlenecking.
[/Script/Engine.Player]
ConfiguredInternetSpeed=${ConfiguredInternetSpeed} ; Sets the assumed player internet speed in bytes per second. High value reduces chances of bandwidth throttling.
ConfiguredLanSpeed=${ConfiguredLanSpeed}           ; Sets the LAN speed, ensuring LAN players can utilize maximum network capacity.

; Socket Subsystem Epic Configuration
; Tailoring the max client rate for both local and internet clients, this optimizes data transfer rates,
; ensuring that the server can handle high volumes of data without causing lag.
[/Script/SocketSubsystemSpic.EpicNetDriver]
MaxClientRate=${MaxClientRate}                 ; Maximum data transfer rate per client for all connections, set to a high value to prevent data capping.
MaxInternetClientRate=${MaxInternetClientRate} ; Specifically targets internet clients, allowing for high-volume data transfer without restrictions.

; Engine Configuration
; These settings manage how the game's frame rate is handled, which can impact how smoothly the game runs.
; Smoother frame rates can lead to a better synchronization between client and server.
[/Script/Engine.Engine]
bSmoothFrameRate=${bSmoothFrameRate}               ; Enables the game engine to smooth out frame rate fluctuations for a more consistent visual experience.
SmoothedFrameRateRange=(LowerBound=(Type=Inclusive,Value=${SmoothedFrameRateRangeLowerBound}),UpperBound=(Type=Exclusive,Value=${SmoothedFrameRateRangeUpperBound})) ; Sets a target frame rate range for smoothing.
MinDesiredFrameRate=${MinDesiredFrameRate}         ; Specifies a minimum acceptable frame rate, ensuring the game runs smoothly at least at this frame rate.
bUseFixedFrameRate=${bUseFixedFrameRate}           ; Disables the use of a fixed frame rate, allowing the game to dynamically adjust frame rate for optimal performance.
FixedFrameRate=${FixedFrameRate}                   ; (Not active due to bUseFixedFrameRate set to false) Placeholder for a fixed frame rate if needed.
NetClientTicksPerSecond=${NetClientTicksPerSecond} ; Increases the update frequency for clients, enhancing responsiveness and reducing lag.


; Garbage Collection Settings
; These settings manage how the game handles memory management and garbage collection,
; which can impact the game's performance and stability.
[/Script/Engine.GarbageCollectionSettings]
TimeBetweenPurgingPendingKillObjects=${TimeBetweenPurgingPendingKillObjects} ; Sets the time in seconds between purging pending kill objects, freeing up memory and reducing memory leaks.


; Renderer Settings
; These settings manage how the game's rendering is handled, which can impact the game's performance and visual quality.
; Enabling threaded rendering and physics can improve performance by distributing the workload across multiple threads.
[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]
r.ThreadedRendering=${rThreadedRendering} ; Enables threaded rendering, distributing the rendering workload across multiple threads for improved performance.
r.ThreadedPhysics=${rThreadedPhysics}   ; Enables threaded physics, distributing the physics workload across multiple threads for improved performance.
